## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My capstone project is a dye formula calculator tool for my sister’s company - La Bien Aimee. It will be a Web App UI. My sister owns a small, artisan wool company that specializes in hand-dyed yarns for knitting. She has a small team of dyers who dye hundreds of skeins of yarn everyday. They do many calculations by hand to determine the amount of dye they need for each type of wool. Each day, these calculations take up to 1.5 hours of their time. My capstone project will not only quickly calculate these formulas for her dye team, but also store the dye formulas in a database. 

### Features
1. User Login - Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the web app. 

2. Calculator Tool - Users will be able to input the Name, Base, Numbers of skeins to calculate the amount of dye needed.

3. Database - The web app will store all dye formulas in a relational database. They will be able to create new ‘Allocations’ or batch names to have a record of their dye history. 

4. Search function - Users will be able to search
